### Instructions for Public Comment

You may provide feedback in three ways:

1. Content suggestions and discussions are welcome via GitHub “issues.” Each issue is a conversation initiated by a member of the public. We encourage you to browse and [join in on discussions](https://github.com/{{ site.org_name }}/{{ site.repo_name }}/issues) in existing issues, or start a new conversation by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/{{ site.org_name }}/{{ site.repo_name }}/issues/new).
2. Direct changes and line edits to the content may be submitted through a ["pull request"](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) by clicking ["Edit this page"](https://github.com/{{ site.org_name }}/{{ site.repo_name }}/edit/{{ site.branch }}/{{ page.path }}). You do not need to install any software to suggest a change. You can use GitHub's in-browser editor to edit files and submit a pull request for your changes to be merged into the document. Directions on how to submit a pull request can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). Open pull requests for the proposed guidance can be found [here](https://github.com/{{ site.org_name }}/{{ site.repo_name }}/pulls).
3. Send your content suggestions or proposed revisions to the *some office* of the *some person* via email to [fake.email@a1b2c3.xyz](mailto:fake.email@a1b2c3.xyz). Please note that all comments received will be posted publicly on this page.
